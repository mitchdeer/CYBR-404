While I was not present for the Career Center presentation due to track, I do know some things as being a member of the College of Business & Technology. Something that we really focused on when I lived in the CBT Learning, Living, Community was Clifton strengths. Though online personal strangth tests do seem rather inaccurate sometimes, I thought my Clifton results fit me really well, and if I saw something I didn't necessarily agree with, I do now. One of my "strengths" is individualization, where I supposedly have the ability to understand the unique qualities of individual people, and I am intrigued by their stories, style, motivation, as well as how they think and build relationships. This is pretty cool when working in a group, becuase I can almost see into the future within the first few interactions. Though I have not acted on this very well in the past, one thing I am going to work on regarding my career development is focusing on connecting and really getting to know and better understand the people I will be working with in the future.
